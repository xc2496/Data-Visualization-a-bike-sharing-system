# # Ford GoBike System Data Visualization
# ## by Xiaowen Chen
# 
# ## Preliminary Wrangling
# 
# This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
# 
# Note that this dataset will require some data wrangling in order to make it tidy for analysis. There are multiple cities covered by the linked system, and multiple data files will need to be joined together if a full yearâ€™s coverage is desired.

# ### What is the structure of your dataset?
# 
# > The dataset includes:
# 
# 1. Bike IDs
# 2. How long was the bike rent for, in seconds
# 3. The information about end station ID, latitude, longitude and name.
# 4. The memeber's date of birth and gender
# 5. The information about start station ID, latitude, longitude and name.
# 6. The users' type as subscripted or not 
# 
# 
# There are 2252058 rows and 15 columns of the dataset
# 
# 
# 
# ### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?
# 
# > I'm most interested in figuring out the usage of bike in different user groups, such as different genders or ages. For example, users in different genders may gave different usage bahavior, and users in differnt ages may also have different usage behvaior. The usage behavior can be the duration of using bike, distances and subscribe or not. I am also intereted in when are most trips taken in terms of  day of the week and month of the year?
# 
# ### What features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?
# 
# > I assume the genders do not have much differences in usage bahaviors. I also assume people in different user types have different usage bahaviors.

# ## Data cleaning
# ### Before plotting the data, we need to do the data wrangling. We may need to clean the outliers and destract data.

# In[9]:


#Make a copy before cleaning the data
df_clean = df.copy()


# #### 1. Delete the rows with missing values in gender or birth year 

# In[10]:


#Delete the rows without gender or birth year
df_clean.dropna(subset = ['member_birth_year', 'member_gender'], inplace=True)


# In[11]:


#test
df_clean.isnull().sum()


# #### 2. Convert birth year into the updated age. Check the age and remove the unreasonable ages such as -1, or greater than 117 (Verified oldest person in the world: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_verified_oldest_people) 

# In[12]:


#Create column for user's age
df_clean['member_age'] = 2020-df_clean['member_birth_year'].astype('int')


# In[13]:


#Check for Outliers
df_clean['member_age'].max()


# In[14]:


df_clean['member_age'].min()


# 20 is a reasonable age. 139 doesn't seem like a reasonable age. 

# In[15]:


#remove users with age greater than 100
df_age_tooold = df_clean[df_clean['member_age'] > 100]
df_age_tooold


# In[16]:


#drop those with age greater than 100
df_clean = df_clean.drop(df_age_tooold.index, axis=0)


# In[17]:


#test
df_clean[df_clean['member_age'] > 100]


# #### 3. Change data types. Change users gender and subscription as categorical type. Change ending time and starting time more readable (easier for a categorial visualization)

# In[18]:


#change user_type and gender to category type
df_clean.user_type = df_clean.user_type.astype('category')
df_clean.member_gender = df_clean.member_gender.astype('category')


# In[19]:


#change start_time and end_time to datetime
df_clean['start_time'] = pd.to_datetime(df_clean['start_time'])
df_clean['end_time'] = pd.to_datetime(df_clean['end_time'])
df_clean = df_clean.sort_values(by='start_time')
#change duration_sec to minutes
df_clean['duration_min'] = df_clean['duration_sec'] / 60
#change duration_min to hours
df_clean['duration_hours'] = df_clean['duration_min'] / 60


# In[20]:


# extract start time month 
df_clean['start_time_month']=df_clean['start_time'].dt.strftime('%B')
# extract start time weekdays
df_clean['start_time_weekday']=df_clean['start_time'].dt.strftime('%a')
#change both to category type
df_clean.start_time_month = df_clean.start_time_month.astype('category')
df_clean.start_time_weekday = df_clean.start_time_weekday.astype('category')


# #### 4 According to the ending location and beginning location, we can calculate to get the distances for each observation

# In[21]:


import math
def distance(begin, end):
    lat1, lon1 = begin
    lat2, lon2 = end
    radius = 3963 # in miles (resource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_radius)
    dlat = math.radians(lat2-lat1)
    dlon = math.radians(lon2-lon1)
    a = math.sin(dlat/2) * math.sin(dlat/2) + math.cos(math.radians(lat1)) * math.cos(math.radians(lat2)) * math.sin(dlon/2) * math.sin(dlon/2)
    c = 2 * math.atan2(math.sqrt(a), math.sqrt(1-a))
    d = radius * c
    return d
df_clean['dis_miles'] = df_clean.apply(lambda i: distance([i['start_station_longitude'],i['start_station_latitude']],
                            [i['end_station_longitude'],i['end_station_latitude']]), axis=1)

# ### Discuss the distribution(s) of your variable(s) of interest. Were there any unusual points? Did you need to perform any transformations?
# 
# >I cleaned the data before doing the plot. So in general, the plots look good and reasonable. Some details need to be changed. For the distrubution of distance in miles, few users had a greater than 30 miles riding. They look unusual. I may set the cut point in this situation. 
# ### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?
# 
# > For the age variable, some ages are too large, such as 139. This is definetly unreal age. few ages are greater than 100, so I dropped the users with age greater than 100 for a better visualization and analysis.

# ## Bivariate Exploration
# 
# > In this section, I will investigate relationships between pairs of variables in my
# data. 
# I will mainly take a look at the usage behaviors in different genders. 

# ### Gender and Age

# In[37]:

plt.gcf().set_size_inches(11.7, 8.27)


# In the dataset, the male users mean age is slightly higer than female's mean age.

# ### Gender and Usage duration in minutes

# In[38]:


#remove abnormal duration

plt.gcf().set_size_inches(11.7, 8.27)


# In general, females are using the bike for a slightly longer time than males in mean. Duration mean in other genders are slighter higher than males and lower than females.

# ### Gender and Usage distance in miles

# In[40]:


#remove abnormal distance
df_distance_abnormal = bike[bike['dis_miles'] > 3]
df_distance_abnormal
bike_2 = bike.drop(df_distance_abnormal.index, axis=0)


# In[41]:

# In general, the genders have very similar distance in miles. Females are using the bike for a slightly longer distance in mean than males. 

# ### Gender and Weekday usge 

# In[42]:


week = ['Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun']
g = sb.catplot(data=bike, x='start_time_weekday', col="member_gender", kind='count', sharey = False, order = week)

plt.gcf().set_size_inches(11.7, 8.27)


#  The distributions in different gender group do not have significant difference. The users used bikes more frequenctly during the weekdays and the percentages are similar through Monday to Friday.

# ### Gender and Monthly usage

g.set_titles("{col_name}")
g.fig.suptitle('Monthly Usage of the Bikeshare System two user types', y=1.03, fontsize=14, fontweight='semibold');
g.set_xticklabels(rotation=90);


#  The distributions in different gender group do not have significant difference. They have a similar trend to their monthly usage, where it increases from spring and fall until it drops in November, and for the remainder of the winter. The most popular usage month for customers is October. The most popular month for subscribers is also October.

# ### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in the dataset?
# 
# > There isn't any obvious diffrences between genders in weekly usage and monthly usage. Females have a greater mean on the duration of usage than males. There is not an obvious difference between genders in distances.
# ### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?
# 
# >  In addition, in monthly usage,  the distribution in customers and subscribers is slightly different. The most popular usage month for customers is October. The most popular month for subscribers is also October. 

# ## Multivariate Exploration
# 
# First, I will analyze the distributions between duration time, based on genders and weekday usage.

# In[45]:


sb.boxplot(x="start_time_weekday", y="duration_min", hue="member_gender",
                 data=bike_1, palette="Set3")

# The boxplot showed that during all the weekdays, females are using the bike for a longer time than males and other group. On Saturaday and Sunday, the average duration in all genders groups is higher than the avergae duration in weekdays; the 75 percentile duration in all genders groups is higher than the avergae duration in weekdays.

# Then, I will analyze the distributions between distance in miles, based on genders and subscriber.

# In[46]:



# figure size in inches

plt.gcf().set_size_inches(11.7, 8.27)


# The users in all the gender groups and what ever subsribed or not have a right screw distribution on distances in miles. For the users in customer groups, it seems that more people in female and male group have a lower disances comparing to the number of people other gender groups. For the all the users in customer groups what ever their genders are,there more people located in the lower distances than the users in subscriber group.

# Further, I will analyze the distributions between distances in miles, based on genders and weekday usage.

# It is obvious that people in different user types have different usage bahavior. The darker the block is, more rides are occuring.  Most subscribed users are using bikes on the Tuesdays in October and most customers are using bikes on the Saturdays on September. In both groups, people are using bikes fewer during winter seasons. The summer and fall are the most popular for both users. Subscribers are using bikes during weekdays more frequently than customers. 

# ### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of looking at your feature(s) of interest?
# 
# >The multivariate charts helped to confirm some previous observations. Gender is not an obvious variable to determine the differences. The usage behaviors between genders are extremely similar.
# ### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?
# 
# >  The customers prefer to use the Bikeshare on weekends, and the subscribers use the service on Monday-Friday, the most. This was not influenced by gender. Most subscribed users are using bikes on the Tuesdays in October and most customers are using bikes on the Saturdays on September. In both groups, people are using bikes fewer during winter seasons.
